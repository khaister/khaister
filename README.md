### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer based in the sunny Southern California. Currently, I'm working on building a cloud-deployed internal Django backend service for managing prescriptions and related data for [blinkhealth.com](https://blinkhealth.com). I'm also maintaining my personal website [khaister.github.io](https://khaister.github.io) in my free time.
