### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer based in the sunny Southern California. Currently, I'm working on building the backend service for managing prescription and related data for [blinkhealth.com](https://blinkhealth.com). I'm also maintaining my personal website [khaister.github.io](https://khaister.github.io) in my free time.

Take a look at my **[resume](https://github.com/khaister/khaister.github.io/raw/main/resume/khai-nguyen.pdf)** and check out the [sauce](https://github.com/khaister/khaister.github.io/tree/main/resume) to see how I build it 🕶️
