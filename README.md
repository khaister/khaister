### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer based in the sunny Southern California. Currently, I'm working on building the backend service for managing prescription and related data for [blinkhealth.com](https://blinkhealth.com). I'm also maintaining my personal website [khaister.github.io](https://khaister.github.io)

Take a look at my [resume](https://github.com/khaister/khaister.github.io/raw/main/resume/khai-nguyen.pdf) (:octocat: see [its src here](https://github.com/khaister/khaister.github.io/tree/main/resume))
