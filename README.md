### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer based in California. Currently, I'm working on building a AWS-hosted internal Django backend service for managing patient's prescriptions and related data for [blinkhealth.com](https://blinkhealth.com). I'm also maintaining my personal website [khaister.github.io](https://khaister.github.io) in my free time.
